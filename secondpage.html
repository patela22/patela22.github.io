      Lately, I’ve been learning how to cook Indian food. It’s been a mix of fun
      and a bit challenging, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I started
      with some basic recipes like dal, chole, and paneer curry. It’s
      interesting how a few simple spices can make such a huge difference in
      flavor. At first, I thought it was just about following the recipe, but I
      quickly realized there’s a lot more to it. Timing is important, and so is
      understanding how each spice works. I’ve had a few failed attempts, like
      burning the onions or making the curry too salty, but it’s all part of the
      process. I’m still figuring out how to make the perfect roti; sometimes
      they turn out great, and other times they’re just weirdly shaped. But I’m
      enjoying the learning process, and it’s a nice break from studying. Plus,
      it’s pretty satisfying when I get a dish right and it actually tastes
      good. Overall, cooking Indian food has been a fun way to try new things,
      and I’m excited to keep experimenting and learning more.
