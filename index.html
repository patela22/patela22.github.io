    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>
      I am a dedicated software engineering student with a passion for
      problem-solving, data analysis, and innovative technology. I currently go
      to northeastern university where I am studying computer science and
      business administration with a concentration in finance. With a solid
      background in application development, I have honed my skills through
      various internships and a co-op positions at companies including Bain
      Capital and Softsages and through product development clubs at university
      like Generate, where I have worked on several full-stack teams for clients
      like Apprenta and Care-wallet. These experiences have equipped me with
      hands-on expertise in designing data schemas, implementing data pipelines,
      and optimizing SQL queries for large-scale datasets. I am particularly
      adept at working with big data processing technologies such as Hadoop and
      Apache Spark. My approach to software engineering emphasizes clean,
      efficient code and creating solutions that scale seamlessly. I am eager to
      contribute and grow in the fast-evolving tech industry. My skills lie
      mostly in full stack development, but I know extensive object oriented
      design and data science with their respective languages and frameworks.
      When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring new languages and cultures
      or diving into complex puzzles to sharpen my problem-solving skills. On
      the side, I am also learning how to cook and discover new recipes.
